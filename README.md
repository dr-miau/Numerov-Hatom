# Numerical solution of the Schr√∂dinger equation using Numerov method

Code in C-language for the Numerical Methods lessons at UAM-I. Can be used as a base for the study of more complex systems, or comparisson with other pices of code.

# Description

For a review of the fundaments used and some results previously obtained, see h_atomrep.pdf file in the doc directory. Programmed with basic programming knowledge, the code may lack of efficient algorithms.
